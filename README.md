## Personal website project code repository

### About this project

This is my final project for Intro to Web Development at Portland State University.
It is a portfolio and has a section I worked on from an assignment this term, as well as some other personal information.

### Using this site

I hope that navigating the site and accessing information is straightforward, there are two other pages beyond the main page, an image gallery example and my Star Wars homework assignment continuation. The image gallery has more information on my development and plans, but as it is should present the images fine.

### Star Wars page

The Star Wars page will display data from the https://swapi.py4e.com/ API like one of our homework assignments. I expanded on this assignment by adding more of the data categories, utilizing caching, and implementing a search. I have a few notes about using it.

1. If you search before loading any of the data (clicking on the buttons to the corresponding data) it will take a while, because it fetches from each category.

2. Using the buttons or select options for the first time will take a moment to load as it is fetching all the data from that category.

3. The search includes a bit too much of the data and isn't very "intelligent." I mostly just wanted to see if I could implement it.
